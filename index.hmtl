		A senior citizen found lying dazed and confused at a roadside in Mexico claimed a UFO tried to abduct him.

Francisco Acosta Tostado, 68, told authorities he was riding his bike on a state highway when the alien aircraft ran him over and attempted to kidnap him.

Local reports said he was discovered in a prone position in bushes on the side of the road, seriously injured and completely out of his mind.

A photo taken when he was discovered shows Tostado with blood on his shirt and according to a police report he was found with a deep gash in his head.

The incident occurred last month in the city of Paso de Ovejas in Veracruz, Mexico, reported La Voz de Houston.

Policarpio Carvajal was driving along the road when he spotted Tostado lying at the roadside, and instantly alerted emergency services.

Tostado was taken to a local hospital in nearby La Antigua for treatment.

State Police officers from Cardel attended the scene and Tostado was transferred to the regional hospital at Cardel.
